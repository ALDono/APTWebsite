  <p>Greetings! My name’s Aubrey and I'm a Dorset-based freelance web developer with a penchant for crafting digital masterpieces from scratch.

From conceptualization to execution. I’m poised to make my mark in the world of web development, one meticulously crafted website at a time.

  <h2>Ingredients for a successful website</h2>

  <h3>Design</h3>
  <img src="images/web-design.png" alt="">
  <p>At the end of the day, you want to walk away with a website that you’re proud to show off to the world. It’s important to have a modern design that matches your vision, and at the same time creates a great user experience.</p>

  <h3>User Experience</h3>
  <img src="images/user-experience.png" alt="">
  <p>It’s impossible to overstate the importance of user experience (UX). Great UX brings people back, bad UX drives them away. Those people continuing to use your site will ultimately lead to better visibility and better engagement</p>

  <h3>Visibility (SEO)</h3>
  <img src="images/seo.png" alt="">
